# Solar System Education Desktop Application
An Educational GUI application made in Java and JavaFX designed to teach young students about the Solar System.
Uses JavaFX framework to create graphics, object oriented programming to make the code easily modifiable.
Features tabbed interface that seperates lessons (text and image based lessons) and a quiz section that has 10 multiple choice questions.

The file organization is messy, but it can be opened as an Eclipse Project (given that eclipsefx for JavaFX in Eclipse is installed)

Issues: The image files supposedly exceeded math file path length limits when copying from my old harddrive to my current harddrive and did not copy over, so the code will not run because all the code that calls images generates errors. 
All the images were custom made for the project so they took a while to make, and I have not replaced them.
I will attempt to replace them with placeholder images at some point so the rest of the UI is still explorable
