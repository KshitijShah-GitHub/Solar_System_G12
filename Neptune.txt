Neptune, the furthest planet in our solar system is the eighth planet, and also the most recently discovered of the eight. It is approximately 30 Astronomical Units from the sun (the Earth is only 1 AU away). This large orbit radius means the planet only completes a trip around the sun every 165 years. Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane gives Neptune the same blue color as Uranus. Neptune has six rings, but they're very hard to see.
