The sixth planet from the sun would be Saturn, most well-known for its ring of rocks. Saturn isn’t the only planet to have rings, but it has the most beautiful ones. The rings we see are made of groups of tiny ringlets that surround Saturn. They’re made of chunks of ice and rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium. When Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through a telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was seeing. At first he thought he was looking at three planets, or a planet with handles. Now we know those "handles" turned out to be the rings of Saturn. The entire planet, while nearly as large as Jupiter, is only a third as massive, as it’s the only planet in the solar system less dense than water. Saturn’s moon Titan, also larger than mercury is the only moon in the solar system that has its own atmosphere. Information Courtesy “https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-saturn/en/”
