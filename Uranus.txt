Uranus, the seventh planet is the lightest of the outer planets, it’s very cold, and features an axial tilt of over 90 degrees. This makes it uniquely oriented to its side. Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes Uranus blue. Uranus also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark. The outer rings are brightly colored and easier to see. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction as most other planets. Information Courtesy “https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/all-about-uranus/en/”
