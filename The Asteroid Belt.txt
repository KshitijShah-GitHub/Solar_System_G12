Right between Mars and Jupiter (the fifth planet) exists an Asteroid Belt, consisting of rocks and debris too small to be considered as planetary bodies. Scattered in orbits around the sun are bits and pieces of rock left over from the dawn of the solar system. Most of these objects, called planetoids or asteroids — meaning "star-like" — orbit between Mars and Jupiter in a grouping known as the Main Asteroid Belt. The Main Asteroid Belt lies more than two-and-a-half times as far as Earth does from the sun. It contains billions — maybe even trillions — of asteroids. Most of these are relatively small, from the size of boulders to a few thousand feet in diameter. But some are significantly larger. Early in the life of the solar system, dust and rock circling the sun were pulled together by gravity into planets. But not all of the ingredients created new worlds. A region between Mars and Jupiter became the asteroid belt. Information Courtesy “http://www.space.com/16105-asteroid-belt.html”
