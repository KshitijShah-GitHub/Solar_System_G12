Venus is the second planet from the sun and our closest planetary neighbor. Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction most planets do. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. The surface of Venus can be around 467 degrees Celsius but can also go down to – 175 degrees Celsius. Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains. Venus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, the counterpart to the Greek goddess Aphrodite. With a radius of 6,052 kilometers, Venus is roughly the same size as Earth, just slightly smaller. From an average distance of 108 million kilometers, Venus is 0.7 astronomical units away from the sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 6 minutes to travel from the sun to Venus. Information Courtesy “https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/indepth”
