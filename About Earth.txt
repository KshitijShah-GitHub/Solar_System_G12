Earth, the third planet from the sun is the planet you're most familiar with. This is because it is our home, and as far as we know right now, the only planet in our solar system, or rather the universe. In the solar system, we find an improbable combination of conditions that allowed for the evolution of life. Billions of years ago, in the hot soup that was our galaxy, arose a familiar star, the sun. Surrounding this star were condensed spheres of rocks and gas, planets as we call them today. The third rock, Earth, spent years being bombarded with space debris. Space debris including giant asteroid kilometers in diameter brought along foreign substances, including water. The planet, which had recently developed, the core was producing heat. Lots of it. Constant volcanic eruptions and the heat from all those Hydrogen and Helium atoms fusing and refusing billions of times per second to for the Iron Core, began boiling the water that had arrived from space debris. This steaming water went up and acted like a protective barrier, resulting in large quantities of Oxygen and other gasses forming an atmosphere. Now, the Earth, having gained an atmosphere, a magnetic field and water, is almost ready for billions of years of random chemical reactions. The Earth lies in a “Goldilocks Zone” in the solar system, existing in a zone a distance from the sun allows for survivable temperatures all year long, no other planets in our solar system exist in this zone. Life as we know it, evolved from a combination of 20 amino acids that arose underwater as a result of billions of years of atmospheric conditions that allowed for just the right binding of molecules, which when chained together first made single celled organisms. Years and years of changing, mutation and all this other Biology and Chemistry stuff later, here we are, thinking all about it. Information Courtesy Me.
