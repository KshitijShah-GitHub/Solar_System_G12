Jupiter is the first of the Outer Planets, 318 times more massive than Earth, and 2 and a half times larger than every other planet combined.  Jupiter is particularly interesting because it has 67 moons, the largest of  which is larger than Mercury. Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's like a star, but it never got big enough to start burning. It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years. Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about the size of Earth. Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well.
